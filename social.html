                <h2>Open Source</h2>
                <p>HackIllinois is redefining the collegiate hackathon as the first entirely open source hackathon. Students work with experienced open source mentors over 36 hours to contribute to open source through new features, bug fixes, and documentation changes.</p>
                <h2>The Event</h2>
                <p>This year, only groups who work on an open source contribution and add a license will be eligible to win prizes. Contribute to a useful open source tool that you use, an open source project of your own, or join a team led by an open source mentor!</p>
                <h2>Join Us</h2>
